      <h3>Importance of Coral Reef in the Caribbean</h3>
      <p>Thriving coral reefs are spectacular sights that provide homes for many marine species. These marine species include sponges, algae, sea urchins, shellfish and fish.</p>

          <h4>Tourist industry</h4>
          <p>Many tourists visit tropical areas like the Caribbean to observe the beauty of the coral reefs and the creatures that live there. This means that the presence of thriving coral reefs is very important to the tourist industry which is a major contributor to the GDP and foreign exchange earnings of many Caribbean countries such as Jamaica and St. Lucia</p>

          <h4>Fishing Industry</h4>
          <p>Many fish inhabit and spawn in coral reefs. A huge majority of fish live near or on the reefs in comparison to the open sea since food is available to them there. Furthermore, without the coral reefs, some fish would go away or even die faster resulting in less fish being available to fishers. This affects their income as well as the income generated by the country.</p>

          <h4>Coastline Protection</h4>
          <p>It protects coastlines from the damaging effects of wave erosion. This is as reefs create a natural breakwater for strong waves. Waves come upon the coral reefs before reaching the shore and are weakened as a result.</p>

          <h4>Medicinal value</h4>
          <p>Corals have medicinal properties which could be useful as anti-cancer drugs, antibiotics and anti-coagulants. Also, the boulder coral is used as a model for bone implants. These medicines are important in the medical field for patients who need them. </p>
